# ERH Governance

## Complexity vector
- x_s: effective signal sources (post-aggregation)
- x_d: decision depth / high-impact gates
- x_c: context states

## Derived scalar
- x_total: weighted function for reporting

## Ethical primes
- FN-prime, FP-prime, Bias-prime, Integrity-prime

## Reporting requirements
- Track E(x_total) per prime across scenarios.
- Identify breakpoints and apply mitigations:
  - aggregation
  - stricter gating
  - refined context modeling

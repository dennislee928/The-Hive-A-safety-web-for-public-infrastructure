# Route 1 — Baseline (No Download)

## Design principles
- Must work without app installation.
- Must deliver consistent instructions at scale.

## Canonical alert
- Use CAP as the canonical message representation.

## Channel mapping (examples)
- Cell broadcast
- Location-based SMS
- Public signage & PA templates
- Web/social/radio/TV replication as policy allows

## Key constraint
Route 2 must not substitute for Route 1; the baseline is the minimum guarantee.

# Decision Points

This PoC defines a pipeline of decision points (D0–D6), with explicit gating for high-impact actions.

- **D0 Pre-Alert** — acknowledge and monitor
- **D1 Dispatch recommendation** — propose staffing/response level
- **D2 Local guidance activation** — enable low-impact guidance
- **D3 Zone escalation (high-impact)** — dual control + dead-man + TTL
- **D4 Multi-zone/network coordination (high-impact)** — stricter approvals
- **D5 Public warning broadcast (high-impact)** — CAP + consistency checks
- **D6 De-escalation & evidence sealing** — rollback and audit

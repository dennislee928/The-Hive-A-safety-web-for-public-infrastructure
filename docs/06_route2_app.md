# Route 2 — App (Optional Download)

## App functions (PoC scope)
1. **Structured crowd reporting** (zone + time window + confidence)
2. **Guidance** (coarse routing away from congestion)
3. **Check-in / request assistance** (minimal data)
4. **Post-incident feedback** (quality improvement)

## Governance constraints
- Never allow crowd reports to directly trigger high-impact actions.
- Require corroboration + operator confirmation.
- Apply privacy-by-design: minimization, retention, access control.

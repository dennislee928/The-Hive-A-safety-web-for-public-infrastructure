# Architecture Blueprint (Concept)

## Core components

1. **Signal Ingestion Layer**
   - Receives signals from infrastructure, staff, and crowd reports.

2. **Trust Fabric**
   - Device/service identity, integrity, and audit.
   - Includes dual-control approval and secure logging.

3. **Decision Layer (ERH-governed)**
   - Produces recommendations and escalation proposals.
   - Tracks ethical primes and bounded misjudgment growth.

4. **High-Impact Action Gate**
   - Dual control + dead-man keepalive + TTL.
   - Separates “recommendation” from “execution.”

5. **Public Communication Layer**
   - Route 1 adapters (baseline channels)
   - Route 2 app delivery
   - CAP canonical message

6. **Post-incident Audit & Improvement**
   - Immutable logging, metrics reporting, governance review.

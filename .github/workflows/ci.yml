# Note: This workflow serves as documentation for the CI pipeline.
# Individual workflows will be triggered independently based on their own trigger conditions:
# - go-tests.yml: Go tests and linting
# - docker-image.yml: Backend API Docker image build
# - frontend-docker-image.yml: Frontend Docker image build
# - flutter-build.yml: Flutter mobile app build
# - robot-tests.yml: Robot Framework tests
#
# To use reusable workflows, add 'workflow_call' to each workflow's 'on' section.

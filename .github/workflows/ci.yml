# Note: This workflow serves as documentation for the CI pipeline.
# Individual workflows (go-tests.yml, docker-image.yml, flutter-build.yml, robot-tests.yml)
# will be triggered independently based on their own trigger conditions.
#
# To use reusable workflows, add 'workflow_call' to each workflow's 'on' section.

# ADR 0001 — Scope and Non-goals

## Decision
This PoC repository is **spec-only** (Markdown-only) and focuses on:

- System architecture and governance
- ERH-based misjudgment growth control
- Dual-route alerting (no-download baseline + optional app)
- Privacy/legal and abuse-resistance constraints

## Rationale
Engineering a production public-safety system requires regulatory approvals, operational SOP alignment, and extensive testing that are out of scope for a spec repo.

## Consequences
- The repo is suitable for proposals, design reviews, and academic writeups.
- No operational deployment guidance is included.

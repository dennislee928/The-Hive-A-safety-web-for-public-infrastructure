# ADR 0002 — Four Zones and Revised Decision Points

## Decision
Model all environments as Zones (Z1–Z4) and apply a unified decision pipeline (D0–D6).

## Rationale
A common interface enables shared evaluation metrics, comparable governance, and scalable simulation.

## Consequences
- Scenarios can be cross-applied.
- Complexity tracking (x_s, x_d, x_c) is consistent across locations.
